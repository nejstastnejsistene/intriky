A pet [R7RS Scheme](http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r7rs.pdf) interpreter.

I'm writing it first in Haskell because that is easy/fun, and then again in C as an exercise/challenge so that I'm forced to figure out low-level things such as memory management, etc. rather than relying on high-level languages where the hard parts are already done for me.
